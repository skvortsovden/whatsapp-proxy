# WhatsApp Proxy API

A Node.js RESTful API built on top of [Baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys) that allows you to send and receive WhatsApp messages, fetch groups, and interact with WhatsApp Web through HTTP endpoints.

> Built with Express + Baileys  
> Designed to be a plug-and-play WhatsApp automation API.


## Features

- Receive WhatsApp messages via REST
- Send text messages to users or groups
- Fetch WhatsApp group info
- QR-based login via terminal
- In-memory storage (can be extended to a database)


## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/skvortsovden/whatsapp-proxy.git
cd whatsapp-proxy
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Server

You'll see a QR code in the terminal â€” scan it with WhatsApp Web on your phone to authenticate.
